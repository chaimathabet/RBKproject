        <p>Before you rush into adopting a cat, do realise that having a pet is a big responsibility. Adopting a pet means you need to commit to and take care of it for the rest of its life. They cost time and money and will require medical attention when
            ill or injured. It is important that the pet is accepted by the entire household too. Otherwise, the family may end up in conflict and the pet may end up abandoned – as is the case for many of these cats featured here. That said, if you are
            in a position to adopt a cat, know that your life will be changed forever… for the better.
